    This module uses Log::Any for logging.

FUNCTIONS

  use_riap_package(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Use a Riap package as if it was a local Perl module.

    "Use" a remote code package over Riap protocol as if it was a local Perl
    module. Actually, what is being done is query the remote URL for
    available functions, and for each remote function, create a proxy
    function. The proxy function will then call the remote function.

    Currently only functions are imported. Variables and other entities are
    ignored.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   include => *array*

        Do not load all children, only load specified ones.

    *   into* => *str*

        Perl package name to put proxy functions into.

        Example: 'Foo::Bar', 'Example::Module'.

    *   url* => *str*

        Location of Riap package entity.

        Example: '/Foo/Bar/' (local Perl module),
        'http://example.com/api/Module/'.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.
